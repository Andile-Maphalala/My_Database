# My_Database
 I Perform CRUD functions on a database
This is a modified project I did for one of my homework assignments. I also used entity framework instead of sql but I did not include that 
in this project just sql

All the logic of the program is done under the "Database" controller open it to see my code

Connectionstring is what allows the project to connect to the database. To configure this to run on your PC do the following:
1) Execute the database sql file 
2) In Visual Studio go to "Tools" > "Connect to Database"
3) In In the datasource field pick "Microsoft SQL Server (SqlClient)"
4) In the Server Name pick your local pc server(Will be the same as your SQL Server Management Studio server)
5) By database name field pick "MyShop"
6) Click on the "advanced: button
7) Copy the text at the bottom of the page it look something like "DataSource =....."
8) Press cancel until youre back at the project and replace the string at the SQLConnection with the string you just copied 


Any feedback is welcome and apreciated . I try to better myself in any way i can
